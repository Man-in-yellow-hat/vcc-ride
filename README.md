## Vanderbilt Climbing Club Ride Organizer App

### The Problem
This repo is an iOS application to arrange the ride system for the Vanderbilt Climbing Club.  Currently, a poll is sent out in a GroupMe group chat every practice, which happens twice a week. Our team will create an iOS app which will solve this issue by creating an organizer for rides which will accommodate both riders and drivers. The goal is to replace the polls with editable default preferences and to have the app automatically assign driversâ€™ pickup locations, which is currently the hardest part of the daily routine. We will have three user roles: administrator, user, and driver. Each user role will have its own dashboard on practice days these roles will interact via the pickup process. The only additional complexity will be adding SMS text notifications, but this should not waver too far from the scope of the project. 

### Stack Choice 
Since we are making an iOS app, there is only one true framework to use which is Swift and SwiftUI. We settled on Realm.io for our database solution. 

### Initial Roles 

| Name| Role|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Aman| Front End |
| Nathan | Back End |
| Junwoon | Back End |
| Karen | Database |

*These are simply guidelines, but we plan to float around on an as needed basis.
